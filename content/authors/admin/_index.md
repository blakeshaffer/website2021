Hello! Welcome to my site.

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Calgary where I work on electricity markets, climate policy and energy transitions. I tend to use empirical methods to evaluate policy effectiveness and better understand consumer and firm behaviour. My goal is to bring rigorous evidence to help policy makers craft better policy.

Prior to returning to academia, I had a 15 year career in energy trading, specializing in electricity, natural gas and emissions markets. I received my PhD in economics from the University of Calgary, Master of Philosophy in economics from the University of Cambridge and a bachelor’s degree in environmental sciences from Queen’s University. I recently held visiting scholar and Fulbright postdoctoral scholar positions at the Toulouse School of Economics and Stanford University.

My recent research has been published in Nature, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, Canadian Journal of Economics, Canadian Public Policy, Energy Economics, and the Energy Journal. My popular writing has appeared in the Globe and Mail, Maclean’s, CBC, and other media outlets. I am frequently asked to provide policy advisor services for governments at various levels on energy and environmental policy matters.

Vaccine hesitancy is a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite their availability.\nObjective: We aimed to identify which people are more and less likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy to inform public health messaging.\nMethods: A Canadian cross-sectional survey was conducted in Canada in October and November 2020, prior to the regulatory approval of the COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy was measured by respondents answering the question “what would you do if a COVID-19 vaccine were available to you?” Negative binomial regression was used to identify the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct clusters based on intention to take a COVID-19 vaccine, beliefs about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions.\nResults: Of 4498 participants, 2876 (63.9%) reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with (1) younger age (18-39 years), (2) lower education, and (3) non-Liberal political leaning. Participants that reported vaccine hesitancy were less likely to believe that a COVID-19 vaccine would end the pandemic or that the benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine outweighed the risks. Individuals with vaccine hesitancy had higher prevalence of being concerned about vaccine side effects, lower prevalence of being influenced by peers or health care professionals, and lower prevalence of trust in government institutions.\nConclusions: These findings can be used to inform targeted public health messaging to combat vaccine hesitancy as COVID-19 vaccine administration continues. Messaging related to preventing COVID among friends and family, highlighting the benefits, emphasizing safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, and ensuring that health care workers are knowledgeable and supported in their vaccination counselling may be effective for vaccine-hesitant populations.","tags":["COVID-19","public health","vaccines","attitudes and behaviours"],"title":"COVID-19 Vaccine–Related Attitudes and Beliefs in Canada: National Cross-sectional Survey and Cluster Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Winter","Megan Bailey","Emily Galley","Chris Joseph","Blake Shaffer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636416000,"objectID":"0ce615e807709c09d96050512f1e7d11","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/spp_coal_2021/","publishdate":"2021-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spp_coal_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"A multiple account benefit-cost analysis of coal mining in Alberta","tags":["coal","Alberta","cost benefit analysis"],"title":"A multiple account benefit-cost analysis of coal mining in Alberta","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raynell Lang","Omid Atabati","Robert Oxoby","Mehdi Mourali","Blake Shaffer","Hasan Sheikh","Madison Fullerton","Theresa Tang","Jeanna Leigh","Braden J.

Using self-reported adherence to NPIs in Canada, assessed through a national cross-sectional survey of 4498 respondents, we aimed to identify and characterize non-adopters of NPIs, evaluating their attitudes and behaviours to understand barriers and facilitators of adoption. A cluster analysis was used to group adopters separately from non-adopters of NPIs. Associations with sociodemographic factors, attitudes towards COVID-19 and the public health response were assessed using logistic regression models comparing non-adopters to adopters. Of the 4498 respondents, 994 (22%) were clustered as non-adopters. Sociodemographic factors significantly associated with the non-adoption cluster were: (1) being male, (2) age 18–34 years, (3) Albertans, (4) lower education level and (5) higher conservative political leaning. Participants who expressed low concern for COVID-19 and distrust towards several institutions had greater odds of being non-adopters.

From a national perspective, Canada is well ahead of the global curve in terms of low-emitting electricity. However, the national average masks considerable heterogeneity at the provincial level: 1) low-emitting hydroelectric and nuclear-based provinces (B.C., Manitoba, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario) and 2) fossil fuel-based provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia). Getting to net zero thus requires a careful look at the challenges and opportunities at the provincial level.

We extend recent literature by directly incorporating adaptation in the form of increased air conditioner penetration into temperature responsiveness and focussing on changes to both the level and timing of future electricity demand. The latter is found to be of greater importance in colder countries, where the level effect is dampened by offsetting reductions in heating demand from warmer winters. Seasonal peaks are projected to shift from winter to summer and the diurnal range of hourly demand expands, exacerbating an increasing need for flexibility coming from the supply side due to a growing share of variable renewable energy.","tags":["electricity demand","climate change","adaptation"],"title":"Stretching the Duck: How rising temperatures will change the level and shape of future electricity consumption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer","Grant Bishop","Mariam Ragab"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601683200,"objectID":"47b5ad8153d3dc3070225df64250bec8","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/cdhowe_power_2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cdhowe_power_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The price of power: Comparative electricity costs across provinces","tags":["electricity","retail rates"],"title":"The price of power: Comparative electricity costs across provinces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer","Mokhtar Tabari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"e061f582d1a7eecc59743de8831e3483","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/shaffertabariwp2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shaffertabariwp2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Energy storage has long been viewed as a solution to the growing challenge of intermittent electricity supply. However, energy storage deployment remains limited despite falling costs. One reason for this is current market rules inadequately compensate storage for all the value it can provide. A recent policy change in the United States seeks to rectify this situation by requiring grid operators to compensate providers of frequency regulation services based on speed and accuracy. This seemingly subtle change has a beneficial effect for fast-acting storage resources. Using a difference-in-differences method, exploiting the fact the Order covers a subset of U.S. electricity regions, we find a greater than 30% increase in the number of storage projects in the covered regions. This result highlights the importance of getting prices right and the material effect properly reflecting the value of storage can have on storage deployment.","tags":["energy storage","frequency regulation"],"title":"Paying for performance: The role of policy in energy storage deployment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer","Nic Rivers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"fd7dee74cef2b31e6497d517452239e0","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/riversshafferrebates2021/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/riversshafferrebates2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["climate change","carbon tax","climate action rebate","consumer spending"],"title":"How do consumers spend carbon tax rebates?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"743a61be890aa33aebd2dcfe15c24298","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/aejpol2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aejpol2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines how consumers respond to nonlinear prices. Exploiting a natural experiment with electricity consumers in British Columbia, I find evidence that some households severely misunderstand nonlinear prices| incorrectly perceiving that the marginal price applies to all consumption, not simply the last unit. While small in number, the exaggerated responses by these households have a large effect in aggregate, masking an otherwise predominant response to average price. Previously largely unexplored in the literature, this type of misunderstanding has important economic, policy and methodological implications beyond electricity markets. I estimate the welfare loss for these households to be the equivalent of 10% of annual electricity expenditure.","tags":["electricity"],"title":"Misunderstanding Nonlinear Prices: Evidence from a Natural Experiment on Residential Electricity Demand","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer","Andrew Leach","Nic Rivers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"fc59d6beb87650938d45ace9f718f7fb","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/leachriversshaffer2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/leachriversshaffer2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on electricity  markets  across  select  Canadian  provinces  with  available  data. Using high frequency electricity data, we find electricity demand declined by roughly 10% in Ontario, and by about 5% in Alberta, British Columbia, and New Brunswick. On the supply side, in Alberta we find reductions from some natural gas plants and an increase in net generation from the oil sands region,  while  Ontario  sees  an  increase  in  net  electricity  exports.  Policy implications include potential rate impacts due to fixed charges spread over a smaller rate base, the potential use of electricity data as a real-time economic indicator during the pandemic, and a call to arms to make electricity data across all Canadian provinces more readily available.","tags":["COVID-19","electricity demand","generation"],"title":"Canadian electricity markets during the COVID-19 pandemic: An initial assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"2ac76c2a3442f37353f837c0bd1d9ae0","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/cje2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cje2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The primary rationale for daylight saving time (DST) has long been energy savings. Whether it achieves this goal, however, remains a subject of debate. Recent studies, examining only one location at a time, have shown DST to increase, decrease or leave overall energy use unchanged. Rather than concluding the effect is ambiguous, this paper is the first to test for heterogeneous regional effects based on differences in (natural) sun times and (societal) waking hours. Using a rich hourly data set and quasi-experimental methods applied across Canadian provinces, this paper rationalizes the differing results, finding region-specific effects consistent with differences in sun times and waking hours. DST increases electricity use in regions with late sunrises and early waking hours.","tags":["electricity demand","daylight saving time"],"title":"Location matters: Daylight saving time and electricity demand","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"c1fc0036445c7dee57a916c02e96e75a","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/spp_electricityroundtable_summarypaper_2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spp_electricityroundtable_summarypaper_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The Role of Storage in Alberta’s Electricity Market: Summary of a School of Public Policy Roundtable Event.","tags":["energy storage","Alberta electricity market"],"title":"The Role of Storage in Alberta’s Electricity Market: Summary of a School of Public Policy Roundtable Event","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Free allocation has similarities to other forms of revenue recycling in that it confers a benefit upon its recipients, reducing their financial burden associated with climate policy. There are three main reasons for using free allocation: (1) it is a more precise mechanism to compensate those who are harmed the most from the introduction of carbon pricing; (2) it can help build political support by ameliorating competitiveness risks for vulnerable firms and building constituencies with a vested interest in seeing carbon markets maintained; and (3) free allocations are a useful tool for managing through a period of patchwork climate policy by mitigating emissions leakage—the shifting of polluting industry from jurisdictions with stringent climate regulations to those with lax or non-existent policies. The manner in which permits are allocated matters and we contrast two main methods: grandfathering and output-based allocations. While in the case of grandfathering, firms are incentivized to reduce emissions, which allows them to sell their allowances, it also creates a moral hazard, as firms might discount the value of free allowances or reduce production for the purpose of selling unused allowances, potentially exacerbating the problem of emissions leakage. Under an output-based allocation, firms are incentivized to reduce their emission intensity (i.e., produce more while emitting less), but the incentive to reduce emissions by simply curtailing their production is weakened. To realize the full economic advantages of free allocations, including limiting emissions leakage, it is important that they be allocated on an output basis that is updated regularly rather than grandfathered on the basis of historical emissions.","tags":["carbon pricing","output subsidies"],"title":"The Political Economy of Free Allocations in Revenue Recycling: Six Position Papers on the Options for Recycling Carbon Pricing Revenue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"24b9d6975638d6946ffe45a5b8500b0a","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/spp_royaltyreview_2016/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spp_royaltyreview_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Lifting the hood on Alberta’s royalty review","tags":["renewables","Alberta electricity market"],"title":"Lifting the hood on Alberta’s royalty review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Shaffer","Georgina Santos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1096588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1096588800,"objectID":"2c1cab1ef8a09fc83a3aedd788b27350","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/publication/pwmp2004/","publishdate":"2004-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pwmp2004/","section":"publication","summary":"On February 17th, 2003, the London Congestion Charging Scheme came into effect. Preliminary results show a significant response to the 5GBP (8USD) charge. Congestion over the first year decreased by 30 per cent, overall traffic levels within the charging zone fell by 16 per cent, speeds for car travel increased by over 20 per cent and bus travel became more reliable. Elasticities of demand for trips by car with respect to generalized costs are estimated to be between –1.32 and –2.10. The average marginal congestion cost within the central zone is estimated at 1.65GBP per veh-km (approximately 2.58USD per veh-km). The net economic benefits of the Scheme for the first year were 50 million (78 million USD) and the net revenues, 68 million GBP (106 million USD). Net revenues are being mainly used to improve public transport.","tags":["traffic congestion","London congestion charging","demand elasticities,","road pricing"],"title":"Preliminary Results of the London Congestion Charging Scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://blakeshaffer.ca/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
